# NLP-driven-E-Invoice-Management
## Disclaimer:
This project is inspired by a research paper [FATURA: A Multi-Layout Invoice Image Dataset for Document Analysis and Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11856).

The project aims to automate the entire ETL pipeline such that whenever a user uploads an invoice image, the system automatically extracts the meaningful information, stores it and updates the existing csv which can be used to integrate in the SQL database as per user needs.

OCR is used to extract in Phase 1 of the project to extract machine-encoded text from the text from images in the form of words.
The input data consists of 2000 images which I made available on my [Google Drive](
